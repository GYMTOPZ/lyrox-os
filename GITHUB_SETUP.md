# GitHub Setup Instructions

## 🎯 Quick Setup (Recommended)

### Option 1: Using GitHub CLI (Fastest)

If you have GitHub CLI installed:

```bash
cd "/Users/pedromeza/Whatsapp AI agent Nov-2025/lyrox-os"

# Create repository on GitHub
gh repo create lyrox-os --public --source=. --remote=origin --description="LYROX OS - Autonomous Business Operating System. Transform any business into a self-operating AI-powered company."

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

---

### Option 2: Using GitHub Web Interface

#### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new)

   - **Description:** `LYROX OS - Autonomous Business Operating System. Transform any business into a self-operating AI-powered company.`
   - **Visibility:** ✅ Public (or Private if you prefer)
   - **Important:** ❌ Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
3. Click **"Create repository"**

#### Step 2: Push Existing Repository

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you instructions. Run these commands:

```bash
cd "/Users/pedromeza/Whatsapp AI agent Nov-2025/lyrox-os"

## 🔒 Repository Settings (Optional)

After creating the repository, you might want to configure:

### 1. About Section
Go to Settings → scroll to "About" and add:
- **Description:** Autonomous Business Operating System - AI agents that run your entire business 24/7
- **Website:** (leave empty for now)
- **Topics:** `ai`, `automation`, `business-os`, `saas`, `whatsapp-bot`, `autonomous-agents`, `typescript`, `nestjs`, `nextjs`

### 2. Branch Protection (Later)
Once you have collaborators:
- Settings → Branches → Add rule for `main`
- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks to pass

### 3. GitHub Actions (Future)
We'll set up CI/CD in later sessions:
- Automatic testing
- Auto-deploy to Railway/Vercel
- Documentation generation

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

After pushing to GitHub:

1. ✅ **Repository is live** - You can share the link
2. ✅ **Documentation is accessible** - Anyone can read the vision
3. ✅ **Context is preserved** - Future sessions can reference this
4. ✅ **Version control enabled** - All changes tracked

### For Next Session:

You (Pedro) need to prepare:
- [ ] Emilio Born AI personality prompt
- [ ] Product list (names, prices, Stripe links)
- [ ] OpenAI API key
- [ ] Which WhatsApp number to use

Then we start building! 🛠️

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "fatal: remote origin already exists"

```bash
# Remove existing remote and add again
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/gymtopz/lyrox-os.git
```

### Issue: Authentication Error

If you see authentication errors, you have two options:

**Option A: Use Personal Access Token**
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Generate new token (classic)
3. Select scopes: `repo` (full control)
4. Copy the token
5. When pushing, use token as password

**Option B: Use SSH (Recommended)**
```bash
# Generate SSH key (if you don't have one)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Add to ssh-agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Copy public key
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# Add to GitHub: Settings → SSH Keys → New SSH Key

# Change remote to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:gymtopz/lyrox-os.git
```

### Issue: "Updates were rejected"

If you created the repo with README/license:
```bash
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
git push -u origin main
```
