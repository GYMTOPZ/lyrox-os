## üöß In Progress

### Active Tasks
**Session 3 Preparation:** Waiting for cloud database URLs

### Critical Blocker
**Need cloud databases** - LYROX OS is a web platform, not a local app.

Required for Session 3:
1. PostgreSQL URL from Neon.tech
2. MongoDB URI from MongoDB Atlas
3. Redis URL from Upstash

**See:** [START_HERE_TOMORROW.md](./START_HERE_TOMORROW.md) for detailed instructions.

### Next Up (Session 3)
1. Configure cloud database URLs in .env
2. Run Prisma migrations on cloud PostgreSQL
3. Seed database with Emilio Born company
4. Deploy backend to Railway
5. Deploy frontend to Vercel
6. LYROX OS live on internet! üöÄ

## üß† Architecture Decisions Made

### [2025-10-31] ADR-001: Tech Stack Selection
**Decision:** NestJS + Next.js + PostgreSQL + MongoDB
**Status:** ‚úÖ Accepted
**Link:** [docs/decisions/001-tech-stack.md](./docs/decisions/001-tech-stack.md)

**Rationale:**
- NestJS: Modular architecture perfect for multi-agent system
- Next.js: Full-stack framework with excellent DX
- PostgreSQL: Structured data (customers, sales, products)
- MongoDB: Flexible conversation storage
- TypeScript across the stack for type safety

### [2025-10-31] ADR-002: Pilot-First Approach
**Decision:** Build for Emilio Born first, then generalize to platform
**Status:** ‚úÖ Accepted (Clarified by ADR-004)
**Link:** [docs/decisions/002-pilot-first.md](./docs/decisions/002-pilot-first.md)

**Rationale:**
- Validate concept with real business before investing in multi-tenant
- Learn from real usage patterns
- Faster to market (4-5 weeks)
- **CRITICAL:** Build multi-tenant architecture from day 1, deploy for one

### [2025-10-31] ADR-003: Agent Architecture
**Decision:** Modular, autonomous agents coordinated by central "Brain"
**Status:** ‚úÖ Accepted
**Link:** [docs/decisions/003-agent-architecture.md](./docs/decisions/003-agent-architecture.md)

**Rationale:**
- Each agent is a specialized module (Customer Service, Finance, etc.)
- Agents can be enabled/disabled per business
- Shared memory via unified database
- Central orchestrator coordinates complex workflows
- Scales to enterprise: add more agents without changing architecture

### [2025-10-31] ADR-004: Avoid Double Work (CRITICAL)
**Decision:** Build multi-tenant architecture from day 1, deploy for single tenant
**Status:** ‚úÖ Accepted
**Link:** [docs/decisions/004-avoid-double-work.md](./docs/decisions/004-avoid-double-work.md)

**Rationale:**
- Eliminates 2-3 weeks of refactoring in Phase 1
- Pedro can configure via dashboard (not asking Claude to edit code)
- Database has company_id from day 1
- Code reads from configuration, never hard-coded
- Phase 1 only adds signup/billing (core unchanged)

**Key Principle:** "Build for Many, Deploy for One, Scale to Many"

---

## üîÆ Upcoming Decisions

### Need to Decide Soon:
1. **Hosting provider details**
   - Railway vs Render vs AWS Lightsail
   - Need: Cost analysis, feature comparison

2. **WhatsApp approach**
   - Start with whatsapp-web.js (free, QR-based)
   - When to migrate to Business API (paid, official)

3. **Monitoring/Observability**
   - Sentry for errors
   - What for application metrics? (Datadog, New Relic, custom)

## üìù Session Notes

### Session 1 - October 31, 2025

**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Participants:** Pedro (PM), Claude (Dev)

**What We Accomplished:**
1. Clarified the complete vision (took 3 iterations)
   - Started thinking it was just a WhatsApp bot for Emilio Born
   - Evolved to understanding it's an Autonomous Business OS platform
   - Final vision: Multi-tenant SaaS where any business can become AI-operated

2. Designed comprehensive architecture
   - Multi-tenant from the ground up (even though Phase 0 is single-tenant)
   - Modular agent system
   - Integration marketplace approach

3. Established documentation-first workflow
   - Every session: document changes ‚Üí push to GitHub
   - Enables context continuity across sessions
   - Professional development practice

**Key Insights:**
- Pedro wants to build not just a product for himself, but a platform to sell
- The pilot (Emilio Born) is validation, not the final product
- Need to architect for scale even if we deploy small initially
- Documentation is critical for AI-human collaboration across sessions

**Action Items for Next Session:**
- [ ] Pedro to provide: Emilio Born prompt, product list, WhatsApp number
- [ ] Claude to create: All remaining documentation files
- [ ] Both: Initialize GitHub repo and push everything

**Blockers:**
None currently
