## 🧠 Architecture Decisions Made

### [2025-10-31] ADR-001: Tech Stack Selection
**Decision:** NestJS + Next.js + PostgreSQL + MongoDB
**Status:** ✅ Accepted
**Link:** [docs/decisions/001-tech-stack.md](./docs/decisions/001-tech-stack.md)

**Rationale:**
- NestJS: Modular architecture perfect for multi-agent system
- Next.js: Full-stack framework with excellent DX
- PostgreSQL: Structured data (customers, sales, products)
- MongoDB: Flexible conversation storage
- TypeScript across the stack for type safety

### [2025-10-31] ADR-002: Pilot-First Approach
**Decision:** Build for Emilio Born first, then generalize to platform
**Status:** ✅ Accepted (Clarified by ADR-004)
**Link:** [docs/decisions/002-pilot-first.md](./docs/decisions/002-pilot-first.md)

**Rationale:**
- Validate concept with real business before investing in multi-tenant
- Learn from real usage patterns
- Faster to market (4-5 weeks)
- **CRITICAL:** Build multi-tenant architecture from day 1, deploy for one

### [2025-10-31] ADR-003: Agent Architecture
**Decision:** Modular, autonomous agents coordinated by central "Brain"
**Status:** ✅ Accepted
**Link:** [docs/decisions/003-agent-architecture.md](./docs/decisions/003-agent-architecture.md)

**Rationale:**
- Each agent is a specialized module (Customer Service, Finance, etc.)
- Agents can be enabled/disabled per business
- Shared memory via unified database
- Central orchestrator coordinates complex workflows
- Scales to enterprise: add more agents without changing architecture

### [2025-10-31] ADR-004: Avoid Double Work (CRITICAL)
**Decision:** Build multi-tenant architecture from day 1, deploy for single tenant
**Status:** ✅ Accepted
**Link:** [docs/decisions/004-avoid-double-work.md](./docs/decisions/004-avoid-double-work.md)

**Rationale:**
- Eliminates 2-3 weeks of refactoring in Phase 1
- Pedro can configure via dashboard (not asking Claude to edit code)
- Database has company_id from day 1
- Code reads from configuration, never hard-coded
- Phase 1 only adds signup/billing (core unchanged)

**Key Principle:** "Build for Many, Deploy for One, Scale to Many"

---

## 🔮 Upcoming Decisions

### Need to Decide Soon:
1. **Hosting provider details**
   - Railway vs Render vs AWS Lightsail
   - Need: Cost analysis, feature comparison

2. **WhatsApp approach**
   - Start with whatsapp-web.js (free, QR-based)
   - When to migrate to Business API (paid, official)

3. **Monitoring/Observability**
   - Sentry for errors
   - What for application metrics? (Datadog, New Relic, custom)

## 📝 Session Notes

### Session 1 - October 31, 2025

**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Participants:** Pedro (PM), Claude (Dev)

**What We Accomplished:**
1. Clarified the complete vision (took 3 iterations)
   - Started thinking it was just a WhatsApp bot for Emilio Born
   - Evolved to understanding it's an Autonomous Business OS platform
   - Final vision: Multi-tenant SaaS where any business can become AI-operated

2. Designed comprehensive architecture
   - Multi-tenant from the ground up (even though Phase 0 is single-tenant)
   - Modular agent system
   - Integration marketplace approach

3. Established documentation-first workflow
   - Every session: document changes → push to GitHub
   - Enables context continuity across sessions
   - Professional development practice

**Key Insights:**
- Pedro wants to build not just a product for himself, but a platform to sell
- The pilot (Emilio Born) is validation, not the final product
- Need to architect for scale even if we deploy small initially
- Documentation is critical for AI-human collaboration across sessions

**Action Items for Next Session:**
- [ ] Pedro to provide: Emilio Born prompt, product list, WhatsApp number
- [ ] Claude to create: All remaining documentation files
- [ ] Both: Initialize GitHub repo and push everything

**Blockers:**
None currently
