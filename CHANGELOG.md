## [Unreleased]

### Phase 0 - Pilot Development
Target: November 21, 2025

---

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-31

### Added - Session 1

#### Documentation
- Created complete project structure and documentation system
- Added README.md with comprehensive project overview
- Added PROJECT_STATUS.md for real-time project tracking
- Added CHANGELOG.md for history tracking
- Created docs/ directory structure:
  - architecture/ - System design documentation
  - development/ - Developer guides
  - agents/ - AI agent specifications
  - integrations/ - Integration guides
  - deployment/ - Deployment instructions
  - business/ - Product and business documentation
  - decisions/ - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
  - sessions/ - Session notes for context continuity

#### Architecture & Planning
- Defined product vision: Autonomous Business Operating System
- Designed multi-tenant SaaS architecture
- Planned modular agent-based system
- Decided tech stack: NestJS, Next.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
- Created Phase 0 roadmap (3-week pilot with Emilio Born Coaching)
- Planned future phases (Platform → Advanced Agents → Enterprise)

#### Key Decisions (ADRs)
- ADR-001: Selected NestJS + Next.js + PostgreSQL + MongoDB stack
- ADR-002: Decided to start with pilot (single business) before building full platform
- ADR-003: Chose modular agent architecture with central orchestrator

### Context
This is the initial session where the complete vision for LYROX OS was defined. Started as a simple WhatsApp bot idea for Emilio Born Coaching, evolved into understanding this should be a multi-tenant SaaS platform where any business can become AI-operated.

The documentation-first approach was established to enable context continuity across development sessions, critical for AI-human collaboration.

## Session Notes

### Session 1 - October 31, 2025
**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Participants:** Pedro Meza (PM/CEO), Claude Code (Tech Lead)

**Major Milestones:**
1. ✅ Complete product vision defined
2. ✅ Full system architecture designed
3. ✅ Documentation structure created
4. ✅ GitHub repository initialized

**Key Insights:**
- The product is not just a bot, it's a platform for autonomous business operations
- Must architect for scale even though Phase 0 is single-tenant
- Documentation is critical for maintaining context across sessions

**Decisions Made:**
- Start with Emilio Born as pilot to validate before building full platform
- Use modular architecture to support future multi-tenant deployment
- Build documentation system to preserve knowledge across sessions

**Next Session Goals:**
- Complete all technical documentation files
- Initialize code repository structure
- Setup Docker development environment
- Begin WhatsApp client implementation
